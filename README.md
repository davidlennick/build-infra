thesis work build infrastructure

just a bunch of scripts so I don't have to find everything again

## jenkins

- a few scripts to get jenkins up and running on a kube cluster, using helm charts

## kube

- init scripts that install microk8s
- once more powerful hardware is around, this should switch to use the conjure-up builds

## kube-mgmt 
- stuff to install on any client working with the kube cluster (kubectl, helm)
